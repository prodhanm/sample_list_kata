''' 
Practicing code by using print(), range(), 
and other functions. The goal is to recall usage of method
or loops to get the solutions. Below is a sample list that will
be used for this exercise.
'''

sample_list = [
    469, 755, 244, 245, 758, 450, 
    302, 20, 712, 71, 456, 21, 398, 
    339, 882, 848, 179, 535, 940, 472
]

# 1. print("Elements and count of sample_list:")

# 2. print("Even elements and their count:")

# 3. print("Odd elements and their count:")

# 4. print("Squares of elements of sample_list:")

# 5. print("Sum of elements of sample_list:")

# 6. print("Smallest (min) element of sample_list:")

# 7. print("Largest (max) element of sample_list:")
